1. Introduction

   About the Project:
   This project is a movie browsing platform called "Movie Hub." The aim is to provide users with a simple and interactive way to find movies, view popular films, and explore additional details about each movie, such as its cast and overview.

2. Features

   Home Page:
   Displays a list of popular movies, including options to filter by movies popular today or this week.

   Movie Details Page:
   Shows detailed information about a specific movie, including title, release date,
   overview, and cast list.

   Favorites:
   Users can mark movies as favorites by clicking a star icon, and access a list of their
   favorite movies from the "Favorites" page.

   Search by ID:
   Allows users to search for a specific movie by entering its ID.

3. Technologies Used

   Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla).

   API Integration: The project uses The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data and details.

   Local Storage: Used to store and manage the list of favorite movies.

4. Code Structure

   HTML: Defines the structure and layout of the pages, including the header, main content area, and footer.

   CSS: Styles the pages, making the site responsive and visually appealing.
   JavaScript: Handles interactions with the API, manages favorites, and dynamically updates the DOM with movie data.

   api.js: Contains functions for interacting with the TMDb API.

5. How to Run the Project

   Clone the project from GitHub.

   Add your apiKey.js file with your TMDb API key, and import it in api.js.

   Open index.html in a live server or local server environment.

   Use the navigation to explore features like popular movies, favorites, and movie details.

6. Future Improvements
